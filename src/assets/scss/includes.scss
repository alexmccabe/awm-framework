/**
 * This file is for SCSS that doesn't export CSS directly, so any SCSS
 * functions, mixins or extends. This file is included in './global', but also
 * should be imported wherever required.
 *
 * Import instructions
 * -------------------
 *
 * From within SCSS. This path will change based upon your current working
 * directory.
 *     - @import './includes';
 *
 * From within WebPack / Vue. This is an absolute path to the file, which
 * has mostly been aliased from within './build/webpack.base.conf.js'.
 *     - @import '~styles/includes';
